# Servlets
Servlets are special Java classes with the mission of doing specific tasks, Understood? Let's dive in.

## The example
We have an online shop with products and users. Users buy products and log in to pay them.

**Java structure**
```
  src
  |_ beans
  |   |_ User.java
  |   |_ Product.java 
  |
  |_ servlets
      |_ AccessServlet.java
      |_ ProductServlet.java
      
```

Servlets work by **requests**, so to call them we use the URL we set to them.
> https://localhost:8080/app/access/

We can make POST / GET request so: (DO NOT PASS PASSWORDS BY GET, PLEASE)
> https://localhost:8080/app/access?user=akrck02&password=root <br>

or
```
  <form method="POST" action="https://localhost:8080/app/access">
    <input name="user" value="akrck02">
    <input name="password" value="root">
    <input type="submit" value="Login">
  </form>
```

## Servlets as service
Servlets get data by DAO and gives it to the caller. So WHO is the caller doesn't really matter.<br>
**I explain that** caller can be a JSP page, JSF managed bean or even a Javascript AJAX or Fetch, data is given to them and work is DONE.  

## Advantages, basically universal access and Object Oriented Programming.
Servlest are made in Java so we can enjoy OOP basic concepts like inheritance or interface implementation.
