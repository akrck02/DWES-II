# JSF - Basic structure

JSF  is bassically a JSP file with beans storing it's data, actually **managed beans**.



## Managed what?

Beans in Java are those classes we make to represent data that belongs to the same concept / object.

So JSF takes does **beans** and **manages** them into a scope.



> If a managed bean is set in request scope

```jsp
 <managed-bean>
        <managed-bean-name>repository</managed-bean-name>
        <managed-bean-class>mbeans.Repository</managed-bean-class>
        <managed-bean-scope>request</managed-bean-scope>
 </managed-bean>
```

> It will be created everytime we make a request to a JSF file.



## Create a managed bean

Nothing special here.

```java
public class myBean {
    private String name;
    private Double calories;
    
    public myBean(){
        name = "noname";
        calories = 0.00;
    }
    
    public String getName(){
        return this.name;
    }
    
    public void setName(String name){
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    public Double getCalories(){
        return this.calories;
    }
    
    public void getCalories(Double calories){
        this.calories = calories;
    }
}
```



JSF need getters / setters to wok with the following syntax

```jsp
<h1>
    #{myBean.name} + " : " + #{myBean.calories} + "calories"
</h1>
```
