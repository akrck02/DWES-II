# Controllers

A controller manages all the application flow, get data from models and redirects to the different views. 
<br><br>
**Index method**
> This method is executed if no method is called by URL like "appController/myMethod"


**AppController.php**
```
  class App extends CI_Controller {

      /**
       * Default action of the controller
       * redirects to apps.
       */
      public function index()
      {
        $this->apps();
      }

      /**
       * Get apps of a user 
       * and show the view.
       */
        public function apps()
        {
          $this->checkAccess();
          $this->load->model('repository');
          $this->load->model('people');

          $user = isset($_REQUEST['user'])? $_REQUEST['user'] : $this->session->appig_user;
          $profile =  $this->people->getProfile($user);

          $profile["followers"] = $this->people->getFollowersCount($user);
          $profile["following"] = $this->people->getFollowingCount($user);
          $profile["repositories"] = count( $this->repository->getRepositories($user));

          $this->load->view('header',[
            "view" =>  $this->separate([$user,"apps"]),
            "title" =>  $user." - apps",
            "selected" => 0,
            "token" =>  $this->session->appig_token,
            "entries" => $this->repository->getReleases($user),
            "profile" => $profile,
            "me" => $this->session->appig_user,
          ]);
          $this->load->view('profile');
          $this->load->view('profileApps');
          $this->load->view('footer');
        }
   }
```

Models will get that user apps data, so the controller takes them and show the "apps" view. <br>
**That's all! Controlling app flow and distributing data in views!**
